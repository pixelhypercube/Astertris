# Astertris (Beta)

**Astertris** is a custom Java implementation of Tetris with a unique twist — radial gravity mechanics set in space!  
Inspired by the classic falling-block puzzle game, Astertris adds new gameplay challenges while staying true to the original's addictive feel.

## 🎮 Features
- **Core Tetris Mechanics** – Rotate, move, and place tetrominoes to clear lines.  
- **Radial Gravity** – Blocks fall toward the center of the playfield instead of straight down.  
- **Custom Rendering** – Built using `Swing` with a `BoardPanel` component to visualize the game grid.  
- **Scalable Grid System** – Grid cell size can be adjusted (`cellSize = 10` by default).  ``
